## Machine Learning Naive-Bayes algorithm that learns between the KD of s1mple and Zeus (from the CSGO team Na'Vi).

#### Prerequisites:
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- pylab

An easy way to get all the prerequisites is to use Anaconda as your python interpreter, found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

#### Style for text.txt:

First line = your first player (#0)
Second line = your second player (#1)

player # as an example:
0 = simple
1 = zeus

Below this the numbers are ordered like this:

kills deaths player

e.g. **23 12 0** means 23 kills, 12 deaths, and is the first player (s1mple).
